Destructors for all objects theoretically work.
bkp theoretically trains properly.
progress bar is functional.
need to serialze a bkp network or any trained network for that matter.
need to perform some kind of output to main view - find some kind of chart wizard
when done training a modeless dialog pops up with char to rms error
and a save network dialog pops up, or we add that functionality to menu
need to verify all resources are freed and that we can't make the program crash by feeding
it garbage.


Set random number generator to emit
the same sequence each time it is called.
Don't forget to change it back when 
finished debugging.

bkp module cleans up all resources except for int pointet to by num_weights 
don't know about min_dist but for sure md_num_weights isn't freed up
also the seed for the random number generator is not freed
